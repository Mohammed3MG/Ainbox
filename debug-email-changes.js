📋 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST:

1. ✅ Open your frontend app in browser
2. ✅ Open Developer Tools → Console
3. ✅ Click on an unread email in your app
4. ✅ Mark an email as read/unread in Gmail web
5. ✅ Watch the console for these debug logs:

🎯 FRONTEND EMAIL CLICK DEBUG:
   📧 Email selected: [ID], Current isRead: false
   📧 performEmailAction called: read ["[ID]"]
   📧 BEFORE optimistic update: [Email List State]
   📧 Updating email to read: [ID] was unread: true
   📧 AFTER optimistic update: [Email List State]
   📧 Updated unread count from X to Y

🎯 BACKEND GMAIL WEBHOOK DEBUG:
   📨 Received Gmail Push notification
   📧 Socket.IO email updated RAW: {...}
   📢 Notifying listeners for event: emailUpdated

🎯 FRONTEND SOCKET.IO DEBUG:
   🔥 Socket.IO emailUpdated received: {...}
   📧 BEFORE_SOCKET_UPDATE: [Email List State]
   ✅ MATCH FOUND at index X: {...}
   🎨 COLOR FLIP - Email [ID]: unread → read
   📧 AFTER_SOCKET_UPDATE: [Email List State]

🎯 EMAIL LIST STATE DEBUG:
   ================================================================================
   📧 EMAIL LIST STATE DEBUG - [ACTION]
   ================================================================================
   📊 Total emails: X
   📊 Unread emails: Y
   📊 Read emails: Z
   🎯 Target email [ID]: {id: "[ID]", isRead: true/false, subject: "..."}

   📋 Email List Summary:
     1. ✅ READ   | [ID] | Subject...
     2. 🔴 UNREAD | [ID] | Subject...
     3. ✅ READ   | [ID] | Subject...
   ================================================================================

🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

1. Email state changes are logged with detailed before/after states
2. Each action shows the complete email list state
3. Target emails are highlighted with their current status
4. Color flip logs show exact state transitions
5. Unread count changes are tracked step by step

⚠️  TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you don't see the expected logs:
- Check if Socket.IO is connected: Look for "🔌 Connected to Socket.IO server"
- Check if emails are loading: Look for "EMAILS_STATE_CHANGED" logs
- Check if actions are triggered: Look for "performEmailAction called"
- Check if matches are found: Look for "MATCH FOUND" vs "NO MATCH FOUND"

🎯 NEXT STEPS:

1. Test clicking on unread emails in your app
2. Test marking emails as read/unread in Gmail web
3. Compare the debug logs to see where the flow breaks
4. Check if email IDs match between backend and frontend
5. Verify if the email list state actually changes
