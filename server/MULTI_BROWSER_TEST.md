## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Invitee doesn't see notification
**Solution**:
- Check that invitee email matches exactly: `mustafasurguli89@gmail.com`
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors

### Problem: Event doesn't appear in invitee's calendar
**Solution**:
- Check that the event GET endpoint includes invitees (we fixed this)
- Verify the date range includes the event
- Try refreshing the calendar

### Problem: RSVP buttons don't appear
**Solution**:
- Verify you're logged in as the invitee (not organizer)
- Check that event.user_role === 'attendee'
- Check browser console for errors

### Problem: Status doesn't update after clicking RSVP
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify server is running
- Check that `/api/calendar/events/${eventId}/respond` endpoint is accessible

### Problem: Can't log in as invitee in second browser
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're using a completely different browser or incognito mode
- Cookies are stored per browser, not shared
- Clear cookies if needed
